A simple Python script that turns your terminal into a stage. It animates lyrics with vibrant colors and a smooth typing effect, perfect for a little command-line karaoke.
Dynamic Typing Effect: Watch the lyrics appear character by character.

Colorful Output: Uses the powerful rich library to bring a splash of color to your terminal.

Customizable: Easily change the lyrics, colors, and typing speed by editing a single list.

Lightweight: A small, easy-to-run script with minimal dependencies.
Note - I have added the non rich version of this script too which is commented out, it uses ANSI escape codes.
